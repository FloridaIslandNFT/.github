## 🌊 **About East Sister Rock Island**

Tucked just a short boat ride from Marathon, Florida, East Sister Rock Island is more than just a private island — it’s a piece of paradise that combines natural beauty, eco-conscious living, and now, cutting-edge blockchain technology.

This 1.25-acre coral reef island has been a sought-after destination for over two decades. With an off-grid wind and solar power system, a 15,000-gallon rainwater cistern, and some of the most pristine waters in the world for fishing and diving, East Sister Rock Island is an oasis for adventurers and luxury seekers alike. 🌴⚓

But the story of this island is about to take an exciting new turn…
