# **Florida Island Tokenization – Terms and Conditions**

**Last Updated:** 27 December 2024

These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern your participation in the fractional ownership of a private island in Marathon, Florida (“East Sister Rock Island” or “the Property”) through the purchase and holding of ERC-1155 tokens (“Tokens”). By purchasing, holding, or otherwise transacting in the Tokens, you (“Token Holder” or “Participant”) agree to abide by the Terms set forth below. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not participate in the Token offering.

---

## **1. Overview**

1.1 **Tokenization**

-   Florida Island Tokenization (“the Project”) issues up to 1,000 ERC-1155 Tokens, collectively representing 25% fractional ownership of the Property.
-   Each Token confers certain rights to its Holder, including a share in the Property’s monthly rental income and a share in future sale proceeds.

    1.2 **Scope of Ownership**

-   Legal title to the Property is held in a trust or similar entity (“the Trust”), which remains recorded in Monroe County, Florida.
-   Tokens represent _beneficial_ or _economic_ interests in the Trust; they do not grant direct legal title to the real estate or managerial authority over the Trust.

    1.3 **Use of Proceeds**

-   Capital raised from the Token offering may be used to maintain, upgrade, or operate the Property, as outlined in the accompanying White Paper.
-   The Trust may withhold a portion of revenues (e.g., for ongoing maintenance, taxes, or fees) before distributing dividends to Token Holders.

---

## **2. Token Acquisition and Sale**

2.1 **Purchasing Tokens**

-   Tokens will be offered during a specified sale period (targeted to begin around April 2025). Participants may purchase Tokens via supported blockchain wallets (e.g., MetaMask), subject to any AML/KYC requirements.
-   The initial price for each Token is set at \$4,500 USD, payable in accepted cryptocurrencies or stablecoins, as determined by the Project.

    2.2 **Secondary Market**

-   After the initial offering, Tokens may be listed for resale on supported NFT marketplaces or transferred peer-to-peer.
-   The Trust, or an authorized entity, may impose royalties or transaction fees on each Token transfer, as encoded in the smart contract.

    2.3 **Transfer Restrictions**

-   The Project may enforce ownership caps to comply with Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”) rules or other regulatory limits (e.g., the “5/50 rule”).
-   AML/KYC checks are mandatory for all Participants. The smart contract or dApp may automatically restrict transfers that exceed regulatory thresholds.

    2.4 **No Guarantee of Profit**

-   Purchasing Tokens involves inherent risks, including but not limited to real estate market volatility, regulatory changes, and technology risks.
-   There is no assurance that the Token value will increase, that dividends will be paid continuously, or that any future sale will occur at a profit.

## **3. Rental Income and Dividends**

3.1 **Monthly Rental Income**

-   The Property generates approximately \$100,000 USD per month in rental income under normal operating conditions, excluding special events.
-   Actual monthly income may fluctuate due to market demand, maintenance downtime, force majeure events, or other factors.

    3.2 **Distribution Mechanics**

-   **Dividend Allocations**: 25% of net rental income is allocated to Token Holders, distributed pro rata based on the number of Tokens held.
-   **Quarterly Payout**: Dividends are typically disbursed quarterly to reduce administrative costs and gas fees.
-   **Withdrawal**: Token Holders must connect their wallets via the Project’s dApp and initiate a “Withdraw” transaction to claim accrued dividends.

    3.3 **Revenue Boost Tokens**

-   Up to 5 Tokens are assigned “Revenue Boost” status, providing access to an additional 5% revenue pool, shared equally. Each of these 5 Tokens receives 20% of that extra pool.

---

## **4. Island Stay and Membership Tiers**

4.1 **Island Stay Boost**

-   1 randomly assigned Token entitles its Holder to one free weekend (2 nights) per year on the Property.
-   Subject to availability and scheduling; black-out dates or certain restrictions may apply.

    4.2 **Membership Tiers**

-   Tiers (1–4) are based on the number of Tokens held in a single wallet. Each tier grants annual discounts or free stays (per the White Paper).
-   Token Holders are responsible for making timely reservations via the official dApp interface.

---

## **5. Governance and Voting**

5.1 **Operational Control**

-   The Trust (or Project Owner) retains primary authority over daily operations, maintenance, and improvements.
-   Significant decisions (e.g., property sale, major capital expenditures) may be put to a vote, subject to governance modules in the smart contract.

    5.2 **Voting Rights**

-   Each Token generally represents one vote, unless otherwise specified by the governance model.
-   A threshold majority (defined by the Trust or governance documents) is required to approve major decisions.
-   Certain regulatory constraints (e.g., REIT compliance) may override or limit on-chain voting outcomes.

---

## **6. Future Sale and Liquidation**

6.1 **Property Sale**

-   If the Property is sold, 25% of the net proceeds (after liens, costs, and taxes) will be allocated to Token Holders, proportional to the number of Tokens held.
-   “Revenue Boost” Tokens may receive additional allocations if the extra revenue pool is triggered upon sale.

    6.2 **Forced Sale or Buyout**

-   Under certain conditions (e.g., unanimous or threshold vote, eminent domain, significant damage), the Trust may be compelled to sell or repurchase the Property.
-   Token Holders will be notified through the dApp and given instructions on collecting their share of proceeds.

---

## **7. Insurance and Disaster Recovery**

7.1 **Insurance Coverage**

-   The Trust maintains all-risk property insurance. Coverage typically includes hurricane damage, wind damage, flood, and other named storm events, subject to policy limits and deductibles.
-   In a total loss scenario where rebuilding is deemed infeasible, insurance proceeds are disbursed to the Trust, then proportionally distributed to Token Holders.

    7.2 **Hurricane Resilience**

-   The main residence is built on reinforced pilings, designed for elevated storm surge resistance.
-   Post-storm procedures (e.g., dredging) restore displaced sand. Recent engineering upgrades address concrete spalling and strengthen the foundation.

    7.3 **Rebuilding Contingencies**

-   If a catastrophic event partially damages the Property, the Trust may decide to rebuild using insurance proceeds.
-   Token Holders may vote on allocating additional capital for large-scale repairs if insurance is insufficient.

---

## **8. Regulatory and Compliance**

8.1 **REIT Compliance**

-   The Project intends to structure its offering to align with U.S. REIT rules, including but not limited to ownership caps (the “5/50 rule”) and formal registration with the IRS.
-   Sale timelines are chosen to accommodate the one-year window for finalizing REIT documentation post-offering.

    8.2 **Securities Laws**

-   Tokens may be deemed securities under relevant securities laws. The Project, or its authorized entity, shall undertake necessary registrations, exemptions, or filings.
-   Participants may need to meet accreditation or other qualification requirements, depending on regulatory conditions.

    8.3 **AML/KYC**

-   All Participants must pass AML/KYC checks prior to purchasing Tokens or receiving dividends.
-   The Project reserves the right to reject or freeze transactions that fail compliance checks.

---

## **9. Risk Factors**

9.1 **Real Estate Market Volatility**

-   The Property’s value and rental income are subject to broader economic, tourism, and market conditions.

    9.2 **Technological Risks**

-   ERC-1155 smart contracts may contain vulnerabilities. Although the Project plans audits and best practices, the risk of hacks, exploits, or blockchain downtime remains.

    9.3 **Liquidity**

-   There is no guarantee that a robust secondary market will develop. Reselling Tokens may be challenging or subject to significant discounts.

    9.4 **Regulatory Changes**

-   Future laws or regulations could impact the Project’s operations, the compliance framework, or Token trading activity.

    10.3 **Force Majeure**
